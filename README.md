# Elevate Data Analyst Internship: Task 2

## Project: Data Visualization and Storytelling with the Superstore Dataset

This repository contains the solution for Task 2 of the Elevate Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to analyze the Superstore sales dataset, create a visual report to uncover key business insights, and present it as a compelling story.

### 1. Tools and Dataset

* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Dataset:** `Superstore.csv`

### 2. Visual Report: Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard

The deliverable for this task is a Power BI dashboard that tells a story about the superstore's sales performance. The dashboard focuses on answering key business questions related to sales, profitability, and customer behavior.

Below is a storyboard describing the key sections of the dashboard. Screenshots of the actual dashboard are included in the `/screenshots` folder of this repository.

#### **Dashboard Storyboard**

**Main Title: Superstore Performance Dashboard - Unlocking Growth Opportunities**

**Section 1: High-Level KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**
*This section provides an at-a-glance summary of the most important metrics.*
* **Total Sales:** A card visual showing **$2.3M**.
* **Total Profit:** A card visual showing **$286.4K**.
* **Profit Margin:** A card visual showing **12.5%**.
* **Total Orders:** A card visual showing **5K+**.

**Section 2: How is our performance changing over time?**
*This section explores sales and profit trends.*
* **Visualization:** A combination line and area chart.
    * **X-Axis:** Month/Year
    * **Y-Axis (Line):** Total Sales
    * **Y-Axis (Area):** Total Profit
* **Insight:** Sales consistently peak in the last quarter (Q4) of each year, especially in November and December. However, there was a significant dip in profit in Q1 2017 despite steady sales, indicating potential issues with pricing or costs during that period.

**Section 3: Where are our most valuable markets?**
*This section analyzes performance across different regions.*
* **Visualization:** A map chart.
    * **Location:** State
    * **Bubble Size:** Total Sales
    * **Color Saturation:** Profit Ratio (higher profit is darker blue, lower profit is lighter orange).
* **Insight:** **California** and **New York** are our biggest markets by sales volume. However, several states in the Central region, like **Texas** and **Illinois**, show high sales but have a very low or even negative profit margin. This is a critical issue that needs immediate attention.

**Section 4: What are our best and worst-selling product categories?**
*This section breaks down performance by product.*
* **Visualization:** A horizontal bar chart.
    * **Y-Axis:** Product Sub-Category
    * **X-Axis:** Total Sales
    * **Color:** Profit (gradient from red for loss to green for profit).
* **Insight:** **Phones** and **Chairs** are the top-selling sub-categories. However, **Tables**, **Bookcases**, and **Supplies** are unprofitable and are losing the company money. We should re-evaluate our strategy for these items.

**Section 5: Who are our key customers?**
*This section focuses on customer segments.*
* **Visualization:** A scatter plot.
    * **X-Axis:** Number of Orders
    * **Y-Axis:** Total Sales
    * **Bubbles:** Customer Name
* **Insight:** There is a clear group of high-value customers who purchase frequently and in large amounts. We should create a loyalty program to retain these key customers. The majority of customers make infrequent, small purchases.

## 3. Interview Questions and Answers

**1. What is the importance of data visualization?**
Data visualization is important because it transforms complex data into an easily understandable visual format. It helps identify trends, patterns, and outliers that might be missed in raw spreadsheets. Ultimately, it allows stakeholders to grasp insights quickly and make better, data-driven decisions.

**2. When do you use a pie chart vs a bar chart?**
* **Pie Chart:** Use a pie chart only when you want to show **parts of a whole** for a small number of categories (ideally less than 5). For example, showing the percentage breakdown of sales by three main regions.
* **Bar Chart:** Use a bar chart when you need to **compare values** across different categories. It is much better for showing precise differences, especially when you have many categories. For example, comparing sales across 17 different product sub-categories.

**3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?**
To make visualizations more engaging, I:
* **Tell a story:** Structure the charts in a logical order that answers a business question.
* **Use color strategically:** Highlight key data points with a contrasting color and use a simple, clean color palette.
* **Add context:** Use clear titles, labels, and annotations to explain what the chart shows and why it matters.
* **Keep it simple:** Avoid clutter, unnecessary gridlines, and 3D effects. The focus should be on the data.

**4. What is data storytelling?**
Data storytelling is the process of building a narrative around a set of data and its visualizations. It's not just about presenting charts; it's about weaving them together to communicate a clear and compelling message, provide context, and drive a specific action or decision.

**5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?**
To avoid misleading visualizations, I always:
* **Start the Y-axis at zero** for bar charts to avoid exaggerating differences.
* **Use appropriate chart types** for the data.
* **Avoid distorting the proportions** of charts.
* **Ensure labeling is clear** and not ambiguous.
* **Provide context** so the audience understands the full picture.

**6. What are best practices in dashboard design?**
* **Audience First:** Design for the needs of your audience.
* **Top-Left is Key:** Place the most important information (KPIs) in the top-left corner.
* **Logical Layout:** Group related charts together and guide the viewer's eye in a logical sequence (left to right, top to bottom).
* **Keep it Clean:** Use white space effectively and limit the number of colors and charts to avoid overwhelming the user.
* **Enable Interactivity:** Use filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data themselves.

**7. What tools have you used for visualization?**
I have experience using **Microsoft Power BI** and **Tableau**. I am also proficient in creating visualizations in Python using libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
